# Hanoi Gif Renderer

This project is a CLI script that generates an ASCII GIF of the Tower of Hanoi solving process. It was created to explore using Rust's Iterator trait to implement recursive algorithms.

## Features

- Creates a cute ASCII GIF of the Tower of Hanoi solution
- Supports any number of disks
- Demonstrates the use of Rust's Iterator trait for recursive algorithms

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on your system.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hanoi-gif-renderer.git
   cd hanoi-gif-renderer
   ```

2. Build and run the project using Cargo:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage

[Add usage instructions here, such as how to specify the number of disks or any other command-line arguments]
